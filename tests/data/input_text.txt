Bloomberg audio Studios podcasts radio news hello and welcome to another episode of the odd Lots podcast I'm Tracy Alaway and I'm Joe weisenthal Joe I know we did one episode on pod shop yeah on Multi strategy hedge funds but it was primarily focused on their impact on the market and I have to say I still came away from that conversation sort of wondering if I worked at a pod shop what is it exactly that I would be doing all day I would love to know the exact same thing I mean like I guess I have this like very vague sense of sort of they have a bunch of people all focused on their specific areas and the sort of out and they net out a bunch of stuff and it's Capital efficient and you know it's like Market neutral in theory and Etc but beyond that like I still don't really like understand the only thing I know is like they've done really well and many people are launching more of them yes they seem to be all the rage they seem to be where everyone kind of wants to go in the quantitative Finance space at least everyone's sort of aiming for these big names um you know places like Citadel Millennium maybe but my question is like why is it just that they're minting money they're expected to continue minting money in the future or is there something that's like fundamentally intriguing and attractive about working in that space that means lots of people want to get in I mean I think that could be two ways of saying the same thing if they're minting money then that probably is fundamentally attractive to people in that space But I do think like backing up the question is like they what we know is that many funds including apparently even like B tier or c-tier funds have done like very well so I'm just like Curious like how and why and then yeah to the question of like what does it take to succeed in them or who is the type of person who can succeed in this environment all right well I'm glad you put it that way because today we are going to be speaking with someone who has done exactly that succeeded in this particular environment we have the perfect guest we're going to be speaking with jeppi paleo AKA gappy he describes him self as a Constant Gardener someone who's on gardening leave quite a lot he is also the author of advanced portfolio management a quants guide for fundamental investors and I have to say it is one of the funniest books that I've read uh in Quant Finance I can't say It's the funniest because I did read my life as a Quant from Emanuel durman but it's definitely up there and Joe I know I know you enjoyed it too I did you know I like skipped over all the numbers and equations and just looked at the jokes and Greek letters but it's very breezily written for what it is and I did actually I think maybe I learned a little bit even uh in my sort of basic reading of it extremely well written I'm ex extremely excited about this conversation you know you mentioned that our guest is the king of gardening leave if you look in as LinkedIn it really is many different roles well I also have to say he is the only person I know who has both an alpha and a beta tattoo on his shoulder oh wow you know some people do get the alpha symbol but he has both uh so you know a well balanced uh portfolio of tattoos all around the UN Yang yeah so gappy thank you so much for for coming on all thoughts hi Tracy hi Joe so maybe to begin with I'm going to let you explain your previous job history because there is quite a lot what is it that you've been doing in this industry yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure okay good question well I got into this industry almost accidentally I was for a few years a researcher in the math department at IBM research and then I got a little bit bored so the only place that you can the only industry you can work in New York other than you know IBM or Tech is finance so I I got into Finance almost accidentally and then again there is no major plan to you know to to my career choices uh when I was getting board for some reason somebody called me and uh offered me a more interesting job and so I have been been working mostly on the so-called buy side of the industry so the part of the industry that invests actively invests and takes risks so I've worked for for Citadel twice for a small hedge fund as a portfolio manager and then Millennium and Hudson River Trading and I've kind of Taken turns between doing quantitative research and risk management so most recently I was at ason River Trading until the beginning of November I think when people think about like multi strategy hedge funds or pod shop or whatever maybe sort of Millennium is the first one that would come to mind for people if someone asks you how does Millennium make money and they seem to have made a lot of money over the years what what's the answer okay I hope without you know saying anything that is uh proprietary um but I think that or like the business model of Millennium yeah I think that what millennium has excelled that has been the ability to to scale up so to adapt its existing platform to accommodate new new new strategies and new portfolio managers and so sometimes actually in in some of their marketing material they called it something like an investment operating system so it's a
