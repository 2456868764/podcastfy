Bloomberg audio Studios podcasts radio news hello and welcome to another episode of the odd Lots podcast I'm Tracy Alaway and I'm Joe weisenthal Joe I know we did one episode on pod shop yeah on Multi strategy hedge funds but it was primarily focused on their impact on the market and I have to say I still came away from that conversation sort of wondering if I worked at a pod shop what is it exactly that I would be doing all day I would love to know the exact same thing I mean like I guess I have this like very vague sense of sort of they have a bunch of people all focused on their specific areas and the sort of out and they net out a bunch of stuff and it's Capital efficient and you know it's like Market neutral in theory and Etc but beyond that like I still don't really like understand the only thing I know is like they've done really well and many people are launching more of them yes they seem to be all the rage they seem to be where everyone kind of wants to go in the quantitative Finance space at least everyone's sort of aiming for these big names um you know places like Citadel Millennium maybe but my question is like why is it just that they're minting money they're expected to continue minting money in the future or is there something that's like fundamentally intriguing and attractive about working in that space that means lots of people want to get in I mean I think that could be two ways of saying the same thing if they're minting money then that probably is fundamentally attractive to people in that space But I do think like backing up the question is like they what we know is that many funds including apparently even like B tier or c-tier funds have done like very well so I'm just like Curious like how and why and then yeah to the question of like what does it take to succeed in them or who is the type of person who can succeed in this environment all right well I'm glad you put it that way because today we are going to be speaking with someone who has done exactly that succeeded in this particular environment we have the perfect guest we're going to be speaking with jeppi paleo AKA gappy he describes him self as a Constant Gardener someone who's on gardening leave quite a lot he is also the author of advanced portfolio management a quants guide for fundamental investors and I have to say it is one of the funniest books that I've read uh in Quant Finance I can't say It's the funniest because I did read my life as a Quant from Emanuel durman but it's definitely up there and Joe I know I know you enjoyed it too I did you know I like skipped over all the numbers and equations and just looked at the jokes and Greek letters but it's very breezily written for what it is and I did actually I think maybe I learned a little bit even uh in my sort of basic reading of it extremely well written I'm ex extremely excited about this conversation you know you mentioned that our guest is the king of gardening leave if you look in as LinkedIn it really is many different roles well I also have to say he is the only person I know who has both an alpha and a beta tattoo on his shoulder oh wow you know some people do get the alpha symbol but he has both uh so you know a well balanced uh portfolio of tattoos all around the UN Yang yeah so gappy thank you so much for for coming on all thoughts hi Tracy hi Joe so maybe to begin with I'm going to let you explain your previous job history because there is quite a lot what is it that you've been doing in this industry yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure okay good question well I got into this industry almost accidentally I was for a few years a researcher in the math department at IBM research and then I got a little bit bored so the only place that you can the only industry you can work in New York other than you know IBM or Tech is finance so I I got into Finance almost accidentally and then again there is no major plan to you know to to my career choices uh when I was getting board for some reason somebody called me and uh offered me a more interesting job and so I have been been working mostly on the so-called buy side of the industry so the part of the industry that invests actively invests and takes risks so I've worked for for Citadel twice for a small hedge fund as a portfolio manager and then Millennium and Hudson River Trading and I've kind of Taken turns between doing quantitative research and risk management so most recently I was at ason River Trading until the beginning of November I think when people think about like multi strategy hedge funds or pod shop or whatever maybe sort of Millennium is the first one that would come to mind for people if someone asks you how does Millennium make money and they seem to have made a lot of money over the years what what's the answer okay I hope without you know saying anything that is uh proprietary um but I think that or like the business model of Millennium yeah I think that what millennium has excelled that has been the ability to to scale up so to adapt its existing platform to accommodate new new new strategies and new portfolio managers and so sometimes actually in in some of their marketing material they called it something like an investment operating system so it's a system that is a firm that is willing to absorb some relatively new strategy and create an environment for that strategy to succeed and so because of that I think they might be having right now the highest number of individ idual pods maybe close to 300 W and hovering around $60 billion of AUM of assets under management but I would say what is their uh superpower is really their their ability to scale in number of PODS so you mentioned creating an environment for Success there what does that look like at an organization like that what are the sort of like conduits that allow trades in that particular organ iation to be successful so I I would give a sort of idiosyncratic maybe story around the rationale for success of of platforms so I see platforms a little bit like managing an Arbitrage or some kind of gap between the single platform the single manager or the small hedge funds and the fun of funds so if you are a fund of funds you do have the scale but you do not have the ability to observe from a close distance the performance of your vehicles for investment and let's say that they don't perform well you have to wait a year in order to take your money back in the case of a hedge fund platform you could actually not only observe the performance of PMS portfolio managers their skill from a very close distance but you can also help them perform better so you can centralize some of the functions that make them better you know Capital Access corporate access risk management if they perform well to give them more Capital if they don't perform well to take Capital away from them or let them go and at the same time you also solve two for two other problems so one is there is a risk transfer happening because a platform almost by Design otherwise it's not really a platform has a uh pass through fee structure that's fundamental for the existence of a platform that makes really a platform what it is instead of a just multi manager hedge fund like the showw so this means that a portfolio manager is not paid with the incentive fee that the hedge fund as a whole receives from the limited partners but instead the portfolio managers are paid a percentage of their p&l this uh payment uh is passed through directly to the limited partners to to the investors and this basically transfers the risk Direct basically from the PM into the limited partner and so this makes the system more more robust in a sense right and combine this with the diversification across investment Styles and the number of PMs and now you start having a mode around a platform that makes it successful if a entity has 300 pods and everyone's doing their own thing Etc why doesn't the return just become the market return like it seems like cuz there is it right like one intuition could be that this model wouldn't scale I mean I know it does but one intuition could be that this model wouldn't scale that the more you add you over diversify and then you just end up with like whatever like you know like by the ETI ETF or something like that why doesn't it work out that way the simplest explanation for this is actually just uh to look at what a retail investor right would hold in their portfolio so let's say that they are you know long apple and IBM okay they have a little bit of an imperfect version of the market right but what makes their skill is how different are the weights of their apple and IBM Holdings compared to the market okay so you can decompose your performance in your personal account into the sum of let's say the market and your idiosyncratic bets into the stocks now what uh the hedge funds do is they do the same but they completely eliminate as much as they can their exposure or their investment in the market so they run purely Market neutral and Factor neutral portfolios so there is diversification but this indos syncratic bets don't get Diversified away into a big Market but they actually become essentially a bunch of independent bets that by the law of large numbers they tend to have better and better risk adjusted profiles so I still see some platform heads describe like the overall tilt as Market neutral so what do they mean by that exactly I mean they typically run a wide range of strategies so let's focus because it's more relatable let's focus on discretionary Longshore equities and systematic equities cuz everybody knows what the stuff is I love that you think systematic equities is relatable yeah yeah I mean relatively to I don't know treasury bases or sell invol so they mean that typically they do have a so-called Factor model and a factor model is a little bit like having a market model on steroids so you have a market term so you can see your portfolio as having exposure to the market so behaving a little bit like a market and then it's also behaving a little bit like a portfolio that has momentum okay and then it also has maybe a tilt in terms of value the platforms tend to run portfolios that have no Market exposure whatsoever and then they also tend to have controlled exposure in these more exotic factors how do they know that I mean so there someone up there at the center there's all the 300 pods the data gets probably aggregated and sliced in various ways but what is the job or how do they actually ensure that on net their portfolio managers don't have that market beta exposure they typically have at the very minimum they will buy some commercial Factor model which is a model of the market like of your investment Universe how the how a stock behaves how can you decompose the performance of the stock in these various systematic or let's call them pervasive market-wide factors and instead idiosyncratic so you buy them off the shelves I mean they're really expensive and they do a job and so once you have bought them you create some kind of userfriendly interface so that a portfolio manager can always see how the portfolio looks like at any point in time it's a little bit like having an x-ray of you know your body in real time you know you can see oh well my portfolio is is a little bit short the market it's a little bit long momentum maybe there is some crowding exposure whatever and so this is in the hands of the portfolio manager and then there is another layer on top of that which is very important risk management which ensures that PMS are behaving well that they're not going out of scope you know they're not buying micro stocks or you know investing in crazy stuff just going or just going long Nvidia or long Nvidia yeah their if their idea is going long Nvidia probably that's not uh an ideal portfolio manager yeah so the other thing I've been wondering is is how much visibility are there between the different pods within one shop yeah and I I mean that like I I assume there's a centralized risk management system of some sort that is like netting out positions and trying to make use of capital most efficient and that's where a lot of the edge comes from but also if you're just a Trader pursuing your own strategy do you know what the guy next to you is doing do you have that kind of visibility or is the idea to keep everyone sort of intellectually separated so that they're not influenced by each other right that's a good question so there is no really black and white answer to this because uh historically there was a time when platforms had more visibility and more collaboration among pods or at least pods in the same sector for example but I would say that the historical trend has been more and more to give them the tools to succeed but not give them the ability to see into each other's portfolios for example and the rational for this is you probably prefer having independent bets to having maybe correlated bets that could be like maybe a little bit more informed so that's the trade-off let's if we talk maybe we can come up with slightly better ideas sure but yeah I think that the trend is more and more toward no you are not seeing what I am what I'm having what I'm holding talk to us more about the risk manager ment component and again I don't know very much I understand that you know stop losses are very tight and you don't get a Long Leash to lose money and if you're not doing well your capital is reduced if you're doing well I guess you get more and if you do more you get more Etc but from how would you describe the sort of the essence of risk management at the hedge fund level so there are maybe two or three core functions that can be described in a qualitative way but you know I think pretty comprehens expensively and then there there is something that is a little bit more esoteric or like domain specific so let's talk about the general principles okay so you mentioned stop losses so this is very important you know there are there are always stop losses the ones that you know you have and the ones you don't know you have but everybody has stop losses in life okay so those are very important because you could imagine that a PM is a little bit like somebody who's holding a call option and uh you uh you know the PM who's losing money has kind of an incentive to go For Broke maybe sometimes but a stoploss is effectively a a sort of a primitive tail Insurance tail risk management tool on the left tail of a PM so that's very important the second principle is sort of self- enforcing is true diversification so this is where you want to have some kind of risk model that tells you what are the hidden bets that kind of overlap and maybe compound at uh at the aggregate level so that if everybody takes a little bit of factor exposure in the same direction and then you sum this across 300 PMS it becomes a big uh Factor exposure so a p a risk management organization needs to get that right the third thing is making sure that people stay in scope okay so seems trivial but actually that requires a lot of uh domain expertise so understanding the trades what can go wrong from an operational standpoint microstructure standpoint is this Factor drift risk as well or I would say that scope is more like Factor drift or in general strategy drift not only Factor but whereas being in scope is more of um pure strategy drift or just taking risks that a portfolio manager would be uh possibly aware of but that maybe the head of the hedge fund because he's not an expert in that area is not so aware of so the the risk manager has to know very well what's going on and uh an alert talk to the PM talk to to the business head and can you give us concrete examples from your experience of of the kind of things that would set off alarm Bells so is there like I guess you don't have to give us specific examples but you know the kind of thing that the types of examples yeah the types of examples that would catch your eye in a risk management position so we covered a little bit the easy stuff right so the easy stuff is people people taking too much risk first of all it's simple but you know we think in terms of dollar volatility dollar volatility is a little bit like how much you can make or lose in one year for examp like value at risk those kind of kind of value at risk yes I mean most people think in terms of all uh value risk too but okay yeah choose your your risk metric you want to stay within that then Factor exposures okay that's also easy concentration so if you take a meab bet in Nvidia it has to Sur surface okay so this are relatively simple there are uh things that are a little bit more complicated like for example you take some true Arbitrage uh positions where you think that something is running cheap versus rich in say Bond versus futures or you do some kind of funding uh Arbitrage trade where different agents in the investing world have different uh funding rates for for their assets and uh those can break like in a dislocation they can break and so the way that typically manage these things it's a little bit like in merger ARB you you give it a Max size and uh you want to make sure that this is correct that this size is correct and it's monitored so this is stuff that can go wrong do managers like how much do they I mean I'm sure there's sort of I don't know if it's accidental style drift or you know drift is sort of a neutral term how much does the risk manager have to watch out for I guess intentional drift or this isn't working I know this this is not quite my mandate this is not quite what I was made to trade but I could sort of justify it this way or I just see all these lines up over here going up I need to how much of a riskmanagement concern is that okay I think that in general uh the principle should be trust but verified I would say that the vast majority of portfolio managers are very responsible and uh because they're in that role they have been educated to control uh their risks to understand them with occasional uh screw up and so that's why you need to verify got it okay on the opposite side of screwups I'm curious how Capital gets kind of doled out and if I'm running a massively profitable uh successful training strategy do I automatically start give start being given more money to you know play around with or is there some amount of discipline here where you don't want people to be bumping up against you know sizing positions or or additional trading costs and things like that imagine I am the most popular Trader or successful most successful TR think popular also popular success I'm both the most popular Trader and most successful Trader at Citadel what is the process for Tracy getting more money to trade how do I get more popular and successful probably not popular okay assume that you're are popular and successful okay so do you get more Capital you do get more Capital up to a point so there are a couple of of factors the first one is there is like a natural limit where somebody can be too successful and without giving examples but there are large Edge funds whose daily pnl sometimes at points are driven is driven by a single strategy okay and maybe that's Justified right but there is a point where the risk could be just too much because the concentration across strategies are think of PODS as as stocks right you don't want to have 90% of your savings in Nvidia so okay so that's number one so there is some kind of basic eristics then there is just a natural limit to growth for for strategies like there there is a a tradeoff because your your Market impact is is very high and so or there is just a hard size for your strategy so you cannot scale high frequency you cannot scale to infinity even index rebalancing or if you're a consumer PM your costs increase faster than the size of your portfolio so your pnl in in the absence of costs uh goes more or less linear linearly but your costs grow faster than linearly so there is a point where you just uh don't want to to grow all right on the flip side let's say Tracy comes in and she is a PM and she has her uh pod uh how long is she likely to last and what would and what would cause her what would be the threshold which she gets fired I don't have the the statistics on the average tenure of a PM okay if I had them probably I shouldn't say well and also depend a lot on on the on the place okay so how long I would say that it's like everything in life right so like 90% of everything is of poor quality I'm sorry to say but the same applies to PMS but this is another beautiful aspect of platforms by the way okay so let me take a quick diter about this okay because like a beautiful and underappreciated aspect of of platforms is that they act like seves so you go through basically every possible pm on the market and uh there is a turnover let's say of 20% So 20% of PMS more or less are let go every or leave every year but you keep the good ones right and So eventually you have a sufficient number of PMS who really can care make the the business sustainable and and a platform is an instrument for exploration okay so I'm not saying how long they last or whatever right but okay how good need do you need to be I think that if you have a market neutral sharp ratio which for those who are not used to this number this uh basically is a risk adjusted measure of profit so it's you take your p&l and you divide by some measure of risk and you get the sharp ratio if you don't have this kind of Market EXP exposures you call it information ratio if you have an information ratio of one and you're managing your left tail sufficiently wisely you you can survive okay so you know start practicing okay okay but on this note the other thing I wanted to ask you was you know we we tend to talk about these things platforms pod shops multistat as like this one Big Blob basically doing a similar thing but my impression is that the culture varies quite substantially across firms and again there aren't that many that are doing this although as Joe said in the intro the number is growing but when we talk about that kind of cultural variation what do we mean exactly to an amazing extent I think that platforms are shaped by the personalities of their Founders so Islander as a personality and a personal history can has a different one the founders of adson River Trading not a platform you know strict to sensu but you know to some extent multi strategy and so and so the cultures are very affected by by this so if you are a Trader um like Ken Griffin it's more likely that the fund that you work in it's as more of a trading as opposed to maybe a pure technology culture Millennium is very decentralized Citadel tends to run more like uh a centralized and efficient organization so in the words of a of a hedge fund manager you know Citadel is like Singapore and Millennium is like the United States right Singapore very efficient efficiently run technocratic to some extent and the US is is know is messy and inefficient but it's very robust and in a sense you know Millennium has these features of robustness of it's like an organic creature it does change a lot so other some firms are more collaborative I think balasi for example tends to be more collaborative than these other two firms by the way and your mileage may vary between different teams like depending on where you work you can you know it can be heaven or it can be hell all right someone hears this podcast maybe they're in college studying Finance or maybe something in Tech or something engineering or whatever they're like oh this sounds really cool I want to work for one what is sort of the basic path that one winds up maybe first in a pod and then running a pod okay so first of all would like to dissuade everybody who's listening from starting a career in finance okay so everyone's going to take that as a challenge but keep going of course and so I wrote a small document because I got a lot uh of questions like this from from students and the brutal answer is that it's very difficult and and there is some luck involved so it does help to go to schools with a brand name for sure it definitely does help if you want to do quantitative stuff to be a very good programmer and you know you need to have the ability to think quantitatively so that's that's for sure there are coding tests that make the admission a little bit more democratic nowadays but still still it's very selective I am not particularly qualified to give advice on how to get uh foot in the industry I think I have a better view of How To Succeed In how to be happy not succeed how to be happy in the industry so that's probably more important let's hear this yeah yeah so I mean how to be happy in the industry I think that I ask a lot the question of what makes a good analyst or a good quantitative researcher to people and I get very often the same answer which is people who are curious do well and seem to be happy so as usual you need to have passion you need to go you know to get into the weekend and and not being able not to think about a problem so I think obsession helps okay so I think the world belongs to the obsessed for for good or worse in the future like you can see this it's a it's a heavy tailed world so if you want to have a a more stable job and and less absorbing I think being a dentist is a better career path but having some level of obsessions into this stuff is is good otherwise at some point you know you leave the industry it's perfectly fine by the way so this actually reminds me of something else I want wanted to ask you so you you said the world belongs to the obsessed which great line is a very good line but when I read books on quantitative Finance so much of it seems to be about Greek letters for a start but basically sizing and managing risk and how to look at your positions and all of that how do you actually generate trade ideas like where does the strategy come from am I just looking for you know mathematical disl in the market and Arbitrage opportunities or am I thinking like I want to go big on something like AI or clean energy or whatever so I think that there are two Dimensions to your question so the first one is how objectively do you create Alpha okay and so there are only a certain finite number of ways to go about Alpha okay so there are structural structural imbalances that are not adaptively filled because the Market is poorly designed because we don't live in a neoc classical World okay so and so these imbalances persist and how do you exploit this physical Alpha is two ways the first one is you're a freaking genius and you face a wall for two years do research and you come up with an original idea okay there are people like this very few the other is simpler it's like a Renaissance style you are an apprentice in a famous painter's shop and you learn the trade and then you strike it on your own and you make it a little bit better and and even making a little bit better can make a huge difference so I would say imitation plays a big role and and then maybe there is another characteristic which is you just have to have the right makeup in terms of you know Drive tolerance risk tolerance so you know when you I was actually having lunch with a former 72 uh PM now and uh and uh he's biggest uh draw down was $90 million which is by the way not crazy crazy high if you are down half a billion dollars you're literally losing your marbles okay your you know your face looks different so have you seen that oh sure yeah yeah yeah I remember in uh in uh Fooled by Randomness TB talks about watching all of like the hormones of someone who just lost a lot of money like pour out and how pale they look he had a specific comment about that there are so many Geniuses if there isn't an infinite supply of alpha if the structural forces the physical forces as you describe them you know there's only so many sort of these dislocations or reasons why reality is separate from the neoclassical world does it imply that as we see more of these launches and as these hedphones get bigger that the opportunity diminishes yes cool wait why well because everything has a finite capacity that's it I mean and you know there as you as you say Joe right there is there are only that many opportunities and each opportunity has a finite capacity and so at some point everybody is doing the same thing and you get to some kind of equilibrium which is not necessary that everybody makes the minimum rate of return right but you know you mentioned earlier that systematic equities are more relatable than other things like the treasury basis trade and I kind of my personal experience I would beg to differ because I come from a sort of credit background but it reminded me a lot of these firms are becoming bigger presences in the bond market bigger Market making roles and that sort of thing does the daytoday of being in equities versus fixed income in this kind of world is is it very different or do similar principles apply I think it's very different actually you know and why first in fundamental equities your Edge is mostly informational so you do have a model of the world that that differs from consensus and you monetize that it's really informational in the case of a lot of fixed income is truly structural you know there are predictable flows there are well-known imbalances there are different demands for liquidity so it's more uh of a uh strategy or a class of strategies that has skew so you could lose a lot of money and but you collect Pennies on a regular basis so you need to manage risk for that you need to have more capital for that and scenarios for that so the risk management the way you think about investment is different is more scenario based it's less Diversified fundamentally you have relatively correlated bets why isn't the world actually maap to the neoclassical view of the world because there's so much money and there's so much investment and effort being put into spotting any price dislocation anywhere so why is it that with all the money and all of the professionals and the Geniuses and the supercomputers and the AI that are like essentially attacking the question of finding mispriced securities why are there still mispriced Securities in theory everything should get arbed out yeah then instantly right but not in practice well yeah but that's why why not imp why does it even with all the professionals and money trying to do this did there still persist in these anomalies or dislocations whatever you want to call them I don't look I I'm not really qualified to answer but I just see there is only a finite number of professionals yeah you know and there is only a finite number of professionals with a certain risk tolerance so a and there are constraints all around there are constraints on your balance sheet there are constraints on how much money can you lose so there are all sorts of limits to Arbitrage that go beyond the toy model of you know schlier and vishy but they go so that's kind of a funding Arbitrage and the mechanism I by the way it's wrong for that paper I mean it's not realistic not wrong it's like artificial but wherever there is a constraint independently of how many players you have you have a potential inefficiency period and it's not going to go away I have a practical question and I always wanted to ask this of someone and I think you are the perfect person to perhaps answer this but if you are a risk manager at this kind of firm and I don't know you're you come into the office and it's let's say it's like the day of a Fed meeting and Jerome poell comes out and says something completely unexpected or let's say it's 2015 and China suddenly announces they're devaluing the UN and you're looking at your computer screen and you're looking at the various risk metrics how fast do those move and how much of it is calculated in real time versus all the numbers having to be run at like the end of the day when you net out trading positions if you have the right model you should be able to either cap capture those risks directly in a sense imagine you have a sensitivity to to the various points in the yield curve either in your fixed income uh uh portfolio or in your equities portfolio if you capture those well so it's a risk that you know you know you are taking and you can hedge you should see the factor moving but not your portfolio moving okay okay and by the way you can also not have these factors but you may have factors that are proxying this these microeconomic drivers like say for example momentum is one crowding is another and so even if a portfolio manager doesn't think directly in terms of points on the Y curve but they have other related ways of thinking so they can still control for that and then there is unfortunately the case where oh well we never modeled this we do not have a proxy for this and then you're screwed and yeah you don't want to be in that situation typically you know you can see these effects like I mean there was a big surprise when when rates went up a lot of Equity portfolios moved and they really didn't know why and there was no interest rate sensitivity in commercial Factor models so there you go in theory on a day of some sort of unexpected event Tracy mentioned the China un devaluation if everything is working perfectly and you truly do have like completely eliminated your Market exposure does that show up at that level like does it still show up somehow I still can show up in weird ways right so for example you can be Market neutral yeah the market has a big drw down and you still lose money yeah why because the the market the drw down starts weird processes of the risking that affect your portfolio so even if I'm Market neutral somebody's selling my stock uh to reduce their risk and it's affecting me even though I'm perfectly Market neutral so weird things can happen unfortunately you know so there is no perfect model that's a short answer unfortunately you mentioned crowding in multi Strat and the idea that maybe you know eventually you would reach a limit for the efficacy of some of this type of trading what's next for hedge funds so we went from fun of funds to pod shops they became the hot new thing what comes after pod shops what's exciting I'd love to know it's for the next guest to answer I don't know uh this is where you reveal where your gardening your current gardening leave ends and where you're going to wind up next oh yeah my best job is always the next I don't know but so what's next in terms of business model would be very interesting to know what's next so there there are some interesting ideas so there is the idea of alpha capture which is kind of a big umbrella and you know Alpha capture has has an interesting story so there was a external Alpha external cell side Alpha capture that's historically like kind of a creation of Marshall ways an English hedge fund that in 2003 or four uh studied a program called tops where they gathered ideas from the cell side and and that for a while was very profitable and also has lots of other byproducts that that are great now I think it's kind of arbitraged out now there is a similar concept of buy side external Alpha capture so there are firms that are trying to to get ideas from hedge funds small hedge funds that don't have scale they can aggregate them and then they make into a portfolio that's a new business model I don't know how scalable it is how sustainable it is but that's an idea there is definitely a an expansion into privates I have like zero skill or zero visibility into this stuff so that's really another question for somebody else and then there is always product Innovation every strategy is continuously innovating has to has to change so just look at where fundamental equities was 100 years ago right the recommendation was invest in a railway single stock and you know be happy and now we have you know and now we spend hundreds of millions of dollars in alternative data and there are tools and stuff so what is it in 10 years I don't know but it will be very different than it is today I remember you know when I was over 20 years ago when I first got interested in markets picking up the intelligent investor CU of course you know Buffett and Monger into it and like reading is like and so if you buy the Brooklyn real Bond yielding 8% I was like what is this is I just thought it seem so disconnected from I mean I'm sure there's a lot of deep wisdom and I probably should have like internalized it but just in terms of like what they were talking about it seemed so funny because of how how antique it all seemed totally yeah and and so now PMS are quanti fundamental PMS tend to be quantitatively quite literate in the future they will be even different maybe they will be prompt experts I don't know can you be a fundamental PM by just being a domain expert in a certain area say like you really understand biotech or say you really understand the semiconductor industry and you want to trade chip stocks versus and not really have that sort of Quant background but some other expertise so being a domain expert is definitely a necessary condition you absolutely need to be a domain expert and and since you make the example of healthcare super domain experts so a lot of good Healthcare PMS have either worked in healthcare companies they have never practiced but they are domain expert is it is it sufficient to be just a domain expert no I think that you need to be able also to monetize and to risk manage your portfolio and that's very difficult so that's not sufficient but it's definitely necessary how important are the data sets like what if I'm just really good at finding original and alternative data set be someone's analyst yeah it varies a lot so some PMS well okay first of all for for systematic it matters a lot lot period unconditionally for discretionary PMS it varies a lot so some PMS will use alternative data some will do deep research and think uh three months to a year ahead and the reality is that there are not that many data that really help you think at that Horizon so we don't live in the world of really really big data for for fundamental thinking so I think that's interesting I have just one more question which is what do you find most satisfying about your job what what gives you the yeah or jobs yeah what gives you the most pleasure on a day-to-day basis do you feel fantastic if China devalues the UN and you look at you know positioning across the firm and you're not going under or do you feel great if you identify a particular strategy or something like that now the thing that gives me most pleasure when I work is when I do something that is useful and it works for others so I just love the social aspect of working like it's actually a job where you can be of some use to other people and I just uh enjoy that so when things work out like you come up with an idea after multiple failures and and it works you implement it and somebody else uses uses it or finds a value into this and everybody's happier and like and we get drunk together that's great all right just jeppi P logo AKA gappy thank you so much for coming on a lots really appreciate it thank you thank you that was fantastic Joe I feel like that's good life advice if it all ends in people getting drunk It's usually no wait that doesn't make sense sometimes it's really bad yeah don't say that never mind but sometimes it's great sometimes it's good I love that line I feel like the world belongs to the obsessed is just like a really good line that's sort of ominous to me because I don't really get obsessed with anything besides country music and then the rest of my time I'm just like I want to talk about hedge funds one day and then the next day I want to talk about like how energy works I was to say it's not really like you do get obsessed it's just you flip Obsession to Obsession yeah so it's not real Obsession it's kind of dilon wait Tracy have I told you about when I got a job offer at a prop trading shop this vaguely rings a bell so can I tell a quick story go for it so I had traded stocks in college just because it was like the doc ER it was fun it was very easy everything was going up I managed to sell for accidental reasons at good time and I didn't lose all my money anyway I was always I got interested in markets then I graduated with my useless liberal arts degree and I had a job I was making minimum wage working at a deli and I saw this help wanted add at a prop trading shop in Austin Texas and it it didn't seem like they had many requirements so I went they they asked me about my personal trading I played pingpong against the CEO I played this video game that involved me using two joysticks one was to control the tilt of a triangle and the other one was to control the space and I kept it in the Square all right seems weird and I did this other thing where I like typed without like too many typos and stuff like that and there were like 200 people applied and the second round I got one of the four spots that they offered and for reasons that still allude me to this day I didn't take the job I was enjoying making minimum wage at the deli all my friends worked there was like the cool place to work in Austin I didn't feel like giving that up and I didn't and I just like I always think about what if what is my life look like if I took that job the strangest most inexplicable career decision I could ever imagine not taking a trading job from a $5 minimum wage job or whatever it is at the time anyway I'll never know okay well I once got offered a specialty sales position in Bank equities at a Swiss bank and I never question what my future would have been had I taken that job I'm very satisfied but I I actually have a question do you think you were put off by the weirdness of the interview process like did you think that you were going to be playing ping pong and like moving joysticks as part of the job that was fun and I didn't even beat the CEO in pingpong she beat me but she still hired me I don't no I don't know why I can't the only thing I could explain is that in my post colle life I had a cool job where I got to like hang out with my friends in the back of this Deli at a grocery store I didn't really feel like giving it up just yet all right well I do feel like coming out of that conversation with jeppi I feel like I have a much better conception of how multistat actually works and what people are sort of doing on a day-to-day basis and also just maybe a bettering of some of the terminology around the industry totally so now we'll probably do more episodes but I feel like I'm now like roughly grounded in at least some core ideas here yeah and everyone should definitely check out gappy's buy side Quant job advice it's nine pages and it actually it it goes into some detail on
